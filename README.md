# A game about matching and mismatching sets

This is a draft implementation of the [(physical) card game "SET!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game))

I've implemented this as a pass-time over the course of 3 days (about 20 hours of development) back in 2016 just because I was in the mood.

The implementation contains:
- single player only
- core game logic
- custom card designs (simple "programmer art" / polygon shapes)
- very basic WPF animations for the cards
- rudimentary scoring system
- help to find a proper "set", if you can't find a valid combination
- tested to run on Windows and Linux (Wine + Mono); probably runs on MacOS with Wine + Mono as well
